# Mobile Games: A/B Testing & Player Retention

## Introduction

This project is based on a mini project from (Datacamp)[https://www.datacamp.com/projects/184].
Cookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment. It's a classic "connect three" style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color in order to clear the board and win the level. It also features singing cats. 

As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an in-app purchase. In this project, we will analyze the result of an A/B test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40. In particular, we will analyze the impact on player retention.

## Method
The project analyzes the differences in player retention between gate in level 30 and level 40, for both 1-day retention and 7-day retention by AB-group.
In addition, the project also uses boostraping technique to quanfity the certainty of the recommendation.

## Conclusion
Based on results, it is recommended that the company should not move the gate from level 30 to level 40.

## Language
The project was conducted mainly in Python 3, with a bit of R codes for visualization.
